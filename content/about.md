Curious tinkerer, first and foremost.

## Engineering

Find my [resume here](https://github.com/majabojarska/Resume/blob/main/Maja_Bojarska_CV.pdf).

- The object of my tinkering is most frequently either software or electronics, although I do venture into other crafts (e.g. woodworking).
- Currently working at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/) since Sep. 2023, developing [LKE](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) – a managed Kubernetes platform.
- I'm always open to new projects and ideas – scroll down for contact info.
- I'm a member of the [Wrocław Hackerspace](https://hswro.org/), a non-profit society of engineering enthusiasts. We promote free (as in freedom) exchange of knowledge and skills, organize meetups, participate in conferences, and bring the wildest of ideas into existence with our own hands and minds.
- I run a [homelab](@/posts/homelab-notes.md), through which I self-host services and hone my craft.
- I'm a ham, in the amateur radio sense of the word. My callsign is [SP6CAT](https://www.qrz.com/db/SP6CAT).

## Philosophy & Ethics

- Technology by itself is neutral – it's a tool that amplifies the actions of the one who wields it. Value judgements should only be made about its application.
- I believe in the right to repair, and consequently, in the right to own.
  - [Planned obsolescence](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Planned_obsolescence) is evil,
  - and so is [post-purchase EULA modification](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Post-purchase_EULA_modification).
- Software should be free (as in freedom).
  - Big fan of FOSS software, with a paid service and support model. Examples include [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana) and [Sidero Labs (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs).
- Access to all scholarly knowledge should be completely free and open.
- To the best of my cognitive abilities, I will not knowingly contribute to an application of technology, whose explicit intent is to exploit, discriminate against, or otherwise harm people.

## Music :notes:

As a kid, I've played the violin (classical styles) for ~8 years. This undoubtedly helped me develop my motor skills, but the older I got, the more I felt bothered and constrained by the seemingly ultimate goal of accurate piece reproduction. This classical mindset never really resonated with me, which is why in my teenage years, I promptly fell in love with modern, guitar-based music genres. Unsurprisingly, I ditched the violin and taught myself to play the guitar (electric, mostly), which I played actively for 5+ years, and then on/off until today. I believe this shaped my present music taste, which clusters around progressive metal, math rock and modern jazz.

I love complex harmony, rhythm and irregular time signatures. Here's a couple songs (roughly sorted from high to low energy):

- Periphery – Prayer Position
- TesseracT – Of Mind – Nocturne
- Tool – The Pot
- I Built the Sky, Jake Howsam Lowe – Coalesce
- Leprous – From the Flame
- Porcupine Tree – The Sound Of Muzak
- Manuel Gardner Fernandes – Fifth
- Waxamilion, Loam – Mezcalator
- Snarky Puppy – Lingus
- Snarky Puppy – Sing to the Moon
- Chon – Rosewood
- GoGo Penguin – Murmuration
- Chick Corea – Crystal Silence

## Other

- I genuinely like using en-dashes and em-dashes (`U+2013` and `U+2014` respectively). Unfortunately LLMs have a propensity for using the latter, to which I can only hope I'm not confused with one :robot:.
- I have a [cat named Luna](/cat), whom I love very much 🐾.
- My editor of choice is neovim ([config](https://github.com/majabojarska/astronvim_config)).
- Markdown is the superior standard for technical documentation (looking at you, Confluence).
- My sport of choice is gravel cycling :bike:.
- None of the content on this blog is created through generative AI. I believe there are valid uses for this technology, but this blog is not one of them. Abstaining from using it benefits both of us.
  - For me, the value is in the writing. In the practice of clear communication of complex technical concepts, and the self-reflection that comes with it.
  - For you — I hope — it's in the carefully verified information, original thought, and freedom from _AI slop_.
