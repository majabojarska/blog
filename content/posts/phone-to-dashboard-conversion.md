## The idea

I really wanted to have some kind of dashboard display for my homelab. Since my server rack has a 10" form factor:

- relatively small
- not cover server

## Prototype

Power:

- max 5W
- idle 0.6W
- active 1.3W

## What would I do differently now

- Wider side button access cutouts.
- Thinner wall in front of the USB-C port
