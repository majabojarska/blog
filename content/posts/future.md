This is a collection of topics I'd like to blog about next, in no specific order:

- Leveraging systemd hooks to automate a graceful shutdown of K3s.
- Homelab notes, infrastructure, hardware.
- My setup for Kubernetes application state backups.
- How to automate clock-safe reboots for OpenWRT on boards without a RTC module.
- A critique of GitHub's UX around configuring required PR workflow status checks.
